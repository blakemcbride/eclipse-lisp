<H2>Issue TIME-ZONE-NON-INTEGER Writeup</H2>

<PRE><B>Status:</B>       Passed v1 (as amended in v2) Mar-89 by 18-0 vote.<P>
<B>Issue:</B>        <A HREF="iss349.html">TIME-ZONE-NON-INTEGER</A><P>
<B>References:</B>   Section 25.4.1 (Time Functions) (p. 443-444)<P>
<B>Category:</B>     CLARIFICATION<P>
<B>Edit history:</B> 1-Mar-89, Version 1 by Chapman<P>
	      10-Apr-89, Version 2 by Pitman (amendments per X3J13)<P>
<P>
<B>Problem Description:<P>
</B><P>
 CLtL states that the time zone part of Decoded Time is an integer.<P>
 However, it is possible to have a non-integer time-zone.<P>
<P>
Proposal (<A HREF="iss349.html">TIME-ZONE-NON-INTEGER:ALLOW</A>)<P>
<P>
 Specify that the time zone part of Decoded Time is <P>
   1. a rational number (either an integer or a ratio)<P>
   2. in the range -24 to 24 (inclusive on both ends)<P>
   3. a multiple of 1/3600.<P>
<P>
<B>Rationale:<P>
</B><P>
 1. For CL to accommodate all possible time designations, it is<P>
    necessary to allow time zone to be non-integer.  Some places<P>
    in the world are on half-hour or quarter-hour times.<P>
<P>
    There is no demand for floating point time zones.  Since such<P>
    zones would introduce inexact arithmetic, we did not consider<P>
    adding them at this time.<P>
    <P>
 2. This prohibits the perverse use of very incredibly time zone<P>
    magnitudes to get around the year restriction on times<P>
    in portable code.<P>
<P>
 3. This requires time zones to be represented as even multiples<P>
    of 1 second.<P>
<P>
<B>Current Practice:<P>
</B><P>
 VAX LISP allows time zone to be non-integer.<P>
<P>
<B>Cost to Implementors:<P>
</B><P>
 Very slight. Implementations which use integer-only arithmetic<P>
 in dealing with time zones might have to switch to a more generic<P>
 kind of arithmetic.<P>
<P>
<B>Cost to Users:<P>
</B><P>
 Depends on situation. Very slight negative to very strong positive<P>
 effects will be seen by users.<P>
<P>
 In some cases, this legitimizes time zones which are already a<P>
 political necessity and may make life easier for users.<P>
<P>
 In at least one known case, this will make things a little harder<P>
 because `very large' time zones will not be permitted.  However, <P>
 such time zones probably were not really portable to begin with<P>
 so this is more just a recognition of the status quo.<P>
<P>
<B>Benefits:<P>
</B><P>
 See Rationale.<P>
<P>
<B>Conversion Cost:<P>
</B><P>
 In most cases, no user code will have to be modified.<P>
<P>
 In the one known case using `very large' time zones, the user may<P>
 have to write his own time manipulation software if he really wants<P>
 to be portable.<P>
<P>
<B>Aesthetics:<P>
</B><P>
 Probably slightly improved.<P>
<P>
<B>Discussion:<P>
</B><P>
 Haflich was claiming he might want to use very large negative time zones<P>
 to go back in history beyond 1900 (where universal times supposedly <P>
 bottom out).  However, most implementations probably don't represent the<P>
 shifts in calendar system which occurred at various points before that<P>
 time, most implementors present at the Mar-89 meeting seemed to think this<P>
 `hack' was probably not really going to work portably anyway.<P>
