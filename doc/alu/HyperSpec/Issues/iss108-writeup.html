<P>
<B>Problem description:<P>
</B><P>
Many users incorrectly think that package operations can be performed<P>
in any order.  CLtL (p.192) contributes to this misconception.<P>
Programmers need direction on the ordering constraint, especially for<P>
creating packages, since doing things out of order can lead to<P>
confusing or even intractable problems.<P>
<P>
If the definition of a package is scattered throughout a program as a <P>
number of individual forms, it is very easy to read a symbol before the <P>
package setup needed to read that symbol correctly has been accomplished. <P>
Three examples: an inherited symbol that should have been shadowed might <P>
be accessed; a single-colon prefix might be used for a symbol that hasn't<P>
yet been exported; an internal symbol might be created afresh where a <P>
symbol that will later be imported or inherited was intended.  These <P>
problems can be difficult to understand or even to recognize; in some <P>
cases it is difficult or impossible to correct the situation in the<P>
same Lisp image.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Proposal (DEFPACKAGE:ADDITION):<P>
</B>      <P>
Add a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A> macro to the language.  In the description below,<P>
'<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_package-name.html#package-name"><B>package-name</B></A>' and '<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_symbol-name.html#symbol-name"><B>symbol-name</B></A>' can be a symbol or a string; if a <P>
symbol, only its name matters, not what package it is in.<P>
<P>
The syntax of <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A> is<P>
<P>
  (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A> <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_package-name.html#package-name"><B>package-name</B></A> {option}*)<P>
<P>
where each option is a list of a keyword and arguments.  Nothing in a<P>
<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A> form is evaluated.<P>
<P>
Standard options for <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A> are listed below.   Except for :SIZE, <P>
options may appear more than once (this is useful primarily for <P>
:IMPORT-FROM and :SHADOWING-IMPORT-FROM).<P>
<P>
(:NICKNAMES {package-name}*)<P>
        Set the package's nicknames to the specified names.<P>
<P>
(:USE {package-name}*)<P>
        The package is to &quot;use&quot; the other designated packages; that is,<P>
        it will inherit from them.  The default value for this option <P>
        should be the same as it is for <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_make-package.html#make-package"><B>MAKE-PACKAGE</B></A> (also see the issue<P>
        <A HREF="iss238.html">MAKE-PACKAGE-USE-DEFAULT</A>).<P>
<P>
(:SHADOW {symbol-name}*)<P>
        Create the specified symbols in the package being defined, <P>
        making them shadows, just as the function <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_shadow.html#shadow"><B>SHADOW</B></A> would do.<P>
<P>
(:SHADOWING-IMPORT-FROM <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_package-name.html#package-name"><B>package-name</B></A> {symbol-name}*)<P>
        Find the specified symbols in the specified package, import<P>
        them into the package being defined, and place them on the <P>
        shadowing symbols list.  In no case will symbols be created in <P>
        any package other than the one being defined; a continuable error <P>
        is signaled if no symbol is accessible in the package named <P>
        <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_package-name.html#package-name"><B>package-name</B></A> for one of the symbol-names.<P>
<P>
(:IMPORT-FROM <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_package-name.html#package-name"><B>package-name</B></A> {symbol-name}*)<P>
        Find the specified symbols in the specified package and import<P>
        them into the package being defined.  In no case will symbols be <P>
        created in a package other than the one being defined; a continuable<P>
        error is signaled if no symbol is accessible in the package named <P>
        <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_package-name.html#package-name"><B>package-name</B></A> for one of the symbol-names.<P>
<P>
(:EXPORT {symbol-name}*)<P>
        Find or create symbols with the specified names and <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_export.html#export"><B>export</B></A> them.<P>
        Note an interaction with the :USE option, since inherited symbols <P>
        can be used rather than new ones created;  note also an interaction <P>
        with the :IMPORT-FROM and :SHADOWING-IMPORT-FROM options, since <P>
	imported symbols can be used rather than new ones created.<P>
<P>
(:INTERN {symbol-name}*)<P>
        Find or create symbols with the specified names.  Note an <P>
        interaction with the :USE option, since inherited symbols <P>
        can be used rather than new ones created.  This option is useful if <P>
        an :IMPORT-FROM or a :SHADOWING-IMPORT-FROM option in a subsequent <P>
        call to <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A> (for some other package) expects to find these <P>
        symbols accessible but not necessarily external.<P>
<P>
(:SIZE <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/syscla_integer.html#integer"><B>integer</B></A>)<P>
        Declare the approximate number of symbols expected in the package.<P>
        This is an efficiency hint only, so that the package's table will<P>
        not have to be frequently re-expanded when new symbols are added<P>
        to it (e.g., by reading in a large file &quot;in&quot; that package).<P>
<P>
The order in which the options occur in a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A> form is irrelevant;<P>
but since the effects of the entry-making options are context-sensitive, <P>
the order in which they will be executed is as follows:<P>
  (1) :SHADOW and :SHADOWING-IMPORT-FROM <P>
  (2) :USE <P>
  (3) :IMPORT-FROM and :INTERN<P>
  (4) :EXPORT<P>
Shadows are established first, since they may be necessary to block <P>
spurious name conflicts when the use link is established.  Use links are <P>
established next so that :intern and :export may refer to normally <P>
inherited symbols.  The :export is done last so that it may refer to <P>
symbols created by any of the other options; in particular, shadows and <P>
imported symbols can be made external.  Note also the prescription on CLtL <P>
p.178 to cover the case of calling <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_export.html#export"><B>EXPORT</B></A> on an inherited symbol.<P>
<P>
<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A> creates the package as specified and returns it as its value.<P>
It has no other side effects; e.g., it does not alter the value of <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/var_stpackagest.html#STpackageST"><B>*PACKAGE*</B></A>.<P>
The function <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_compile-file.html#compile-file"><B>COMPILE-FILE</B></A> should treat top-level <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A> forms the<P>
same way it treats the other package-effecting functions (see CLtL p.182).<P>
<P>
If the specified name already refers to an existing package, then the <P>
name-to-package mapping for that name is not changed.   At most, the <P>
existing package will be modified to reflect the new definition;  it is <P>
undefined what happens if the new definition is at variance with the <P>
current state of that package.  If one of the specified nicknames already<P>
refers to an existing package, then an error is signaled just the same<P>
as <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_make-package.html#make-package"><B>MAKE-PACKAGE</B></A> would.  See the issue <A HREF="iss253.html">PACKAGE-DELETION</A> for undoing the<P>
name-to-package mapping.<P>
<P>
Some <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A> errors are, however,  purely syntactic.<P>
  (1) An error should be signaled if :SIZE appears than once.<P>
  (2) Since extended options might be allowed by other implementations, <P>
      an error should be signaled if an option is present that is not <P>
      actually supported in this implementation.<P>
  (3) The collection of <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_symbol-name.html#symbol-name"><B>symbol-name</B></A> arguments given to the options <P>
      :SHADOW, :INTERN, :IMPORT-FROM, and :SHADOWING-IMPORT-FROM must <P>
      all be disjoint; additionally, the <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_symbol-name.html#symbol-name"><B>symbol-name</B></A> arguments given to <P>
      :EXPORT and :INTERN must be disjoint. If either condition is <P>
      violated, an error should be signaled.<P>
Name conflict errors will, of course, be handled by the underlying calls to <P>
<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_use-package.html#use-package"><B>USE-PACKAGE</B></A>, <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_import.html#import"><B>IMPORT</B></A>, and <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_export.html#export"><B>EXPORT</B></A>.<P>

  )<P>
<P>
<B>Rationale:<P>
</B><P>
The availability of <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A> encourages putting the entire package <P>
definition in a single place.  It also encourages putting all the package <P>
definitions of a program in a single file, which can be loaded before <P>
loading or compiling anything else that depends on those packages; such a<P>
file can be read in the USER package, avoiding any initial state issues.<P>
<P>
In addition, <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A> allows a programming environment to process<P>
the whole package setup as a unit, providing better error-checking and<P>
more assistance with package problems, by dint of global knowledge of<P>
the package setup.<P>
<P>
<B>Current practice:<P>
</B><P>
Symbolics Common Lisp (SCL) has always had a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A>, and users<P>
prefer it to individual calls to <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_export.html#export"><B>EXPORT</B></A>, <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_import.html#import"><B>IMPORT</B></A>, <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_shadow.html#shadow"><B>SHADOW</B></A>, etc.  The SCL<P>
version of <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A> has quite a few additional options, but none of<P>
them appears to be necessary to propose for Common Lisp at this time.<P>
This proposal is incompatible with Symbolics <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A> in some ways<P>
that will probably not cause major problems.<P>
<P>
<B>Cost to Implementors:<P>
</B><P>
Small--DEFPACKAGE can be implemented simply as a bunch of<P>
calls to existing functions.<P>
<P>
<B>Cost to Users:<P>
</B><P>
Small, this is upward compatible.<P>
<P>
<B>Cost of non-adoption:<P>
</B><P>
Packages continue to be difficult to use correctly.<P>
<P>
<B>Benefits:<P>
</B><P>
Guide users away from using packages in ways that get them into trouble.<P>
<P>
<B>Esthetics:<P>
</B><P>
Neutral.<P>
<P>
<B>Discussion:<P>
</B><P>
It has been suggested that the &quot;Put IN Seven EXtremely Random USEr<P>
Interface COmmands&quot; mnemonic described in CLtL p.191 could be removed;<P>
and with possibly a few exceptions, the special handling of them by<P>
<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_compile-file.html#compile-file"><B>COMPILE-FILE</B></A> could be removed.  As this would be an incompatible change, <P>
it is not part of this proposal.  However, a new mnemonic can be offered, <P>
to help remember the ordering constraints mentioned above:<P>
          I REmember Six USEr Interface Expressions<P>
Each word in the sentence corresponds to one operation listed below:<P>
   I				<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_in-package.html#in-package"><B>IN-PACKAGE</B></A>	;&quot;foot&quot; to stand on<P>
   REmember			<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_providecm_require.html#require"><B>REQUIRE</B></A>		;ensure pre-requisite packages<P>
   Six				<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_shadow.html#shadow"><B>SHADOW</B></A>		;block multiple-inheritances<P>
   USEr				<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_use-package.html#use-package"><B>USE-PACKAGE</B></A>	;go for it!<P>
   Interface			<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_import.html#import"><B>IMPORT</B></A>		;bring in &quot;foreign&quot; symbols<P>
   EXpressions			<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_export.html#export"><B>EXPORT</B></A>		;a &quot;face&quot; to show to others.<P>
<P>
It is noted that <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A> cannot be used to create two &quot;mutually<P>
recursive&quot; packages, such as:<P>
    (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>defpackage</B></A> my-package<P>
      (:use lisp your-package)	      ;requires 'your-package' to exist <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/acc_firstcm_s_inthcm_tenth.html#first"><B>first</B></A><P>
      (:export &quot;MY-FUN&quot;))<P>
    (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>defpackage</B></A> your-package<P>
      (:use lisp)<P>
      (:import-from my-package &quot;MY-FUN&quot;) ;requires 'my-package' to exist <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/acc_firstcm_s_inthcm_tenth.html#first"><B>first</B></A><P>
      (:export &quot;MY-FUN&quot;))<P>
However, nothing prevents one from using the package-effecting functions <P>
such as <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_use-package.html#use-package"><B>USE-PACKAGE</B></A>, <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_import.html#import"><B>IMPORT</B></A>, and <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_export.html#export"><B>EXPORT</B></A> to establish such links (which<P>
ought to be very rare) after a more <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/sec_7-6-6-2.html#standard"><B>standard</B></A> use of <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A>.<P>
<P>
The macroexpansion of <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A> could usefully canonicalize the names<P>
into strings, so that even if a source file has random symbols in the<P>
<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A> form, the compiled file would only contain strings.<P>
<P>
Frequently additional implementation-dependent options take the<P>
form of a keyword standing by itself as an abbreviation for a list<P>
(<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/typ_keyword.html#keyword"><B>keyword</B></A> T); this syntax should be properly reported as an unrecognized<P>
option in implementations that do not support it.<P>
<P>
Definition forms in Common Lisp usually just establish a name-to-object<P>
mapping; there is little precedent for them to modify other global-context<P>
state.  For this reason, we didn't want <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A> also to &quot;go&quot; into the <P>
new package.  If it did so, like <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_in-package.html#in-package"><B>IN-PACKAGE</B></A>, then the following reasonable <P>
file would become confused, because it wouldn't all be in one package:<P>
   (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_in-package.html#in-package"><B>in-package</B></A> &quot;USER&quot;)<P>
   (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>defpackage</B></A> &quot;WATER&quot;      (:use &quot;LISP&quot;)             (:export &quot;FISH&quot;))<P>
   (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>defpackage</B></A> &quot;ALCHEMY&quot;    (:use &quot;LISP&quot; &quot;PHLOGISTON) (:export gold))<P>
Should the token 'gold' be read while in the USER package, or in the<P>
the WATER package?<P>
<P>
The issue <A HREF="iss195.html">IN-PACKAGE-FUNCTIONALITY</A> recommends that <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_in-package.html#in-package"><B>IN-PACKAGE</B></A>  be <P>
incompatibly changed to recognize only existing packages, not to create <P>
them.  <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_in-package.html#in-package"><B>IN-PACKAGE</B></A> would then not accept any keyword arguments.<P>
<P>
The function <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_make-package.html#make-package"><B>MAKE-PACKAGE</B></A> might also be extended to take all the keywords<P>
that <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defpackage.html#defpackage"><B>DEFPACKAGE</B></A> does. This could be the subject of a separate cleanup.<P>
