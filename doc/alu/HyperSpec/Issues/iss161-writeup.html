Do <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/speope_fletcm_scm_macrolet.html#flet"><B>FLET</B></A>, <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/speope_fletcm_scm_macrolet.html#labels"><B>LABELS</B></A>, <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defmacro.html#defmacro"><B>DEFMACRO</B></A>, <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/speope_fletcm_scm_macrolet.html#macrolet"><B>MACROLET</B></A>, <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defsetf.html#defsetf"><B>DEFSETF</B></A>, DEFINE-SETF-METHOD, and<P>
<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_deftype.html#deftype"><B>DEFTYPE</B></A> have an implicit block around their bodies like the body of a<P>
DEFUN?  CLtL is silent on this point.  Many users and some implementors<P>
assume that such blocks should be established, since they view these<P>
forms as analogous with <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defun.html#defun"><B>DEFUN</B></A>.<P>

will return (3 4) if <A HREF="iss161.html">FLET-IMPLICIT-BLOCK:YES</A> is adopted, and would<P>

<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/speope_fletcm_scm_macrolet.html#flet"><B>FLET</B></A>.<P>
<P>
Proposal: <A HREF="iss161.html">FLET-IMPLICIT-BLOCK:YES</A><P>
<P>
Each function created by <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/speope_fletcm_scm_macrolet.html#flet"><B>FLET</B></A> and <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/speope_fletcm_scm_macrolet.html#labels"><B>LABELS</B></A> and each macro created by<P>
<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defmacro.html#defmacro"><B>DEFMACRO</B></A> and <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/speope_fletcm_scm_macrolet.html#macrolet"><B>MACROLET</B></A> has an implicit block around the body.  The name<P>
of this block is that same as the (lexical) name of the function or<P>
macro.  Similarly, the body code in <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defsetf.html#defsetf"><B>DEFSETF</B></A>, DEFINE-SETF-METHOD, and<P>
<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_deftype.html#deftype"><B>DEFTYPE</B></A> is surrounded by a block with the same name as the accessor or<P>
type.<P>
<P>
<B>Current Practice:<P>
</B><P>
Current practice is mixed.  Several implementations do not add the<P>
implicit block, others do, some add some of these blocks and not others.<P>
<P>
<B>Cost of adopting this change:<P>
</B><P>
Some implementations will have to be modified.  This should be a<P>
relatively easy modification.<P>
<P>
<B>Cost of not adopting the change:<P>
</B><P>
If the issue is not clarified one way or another, continuing confusion<P>
will result in portability problems.  Clarifying the issue in any other<P>
way would also <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_providecm_require.html#require"><B>require</B></A> modifications in some implementations.<P>
<P>
<B>Cost of converting existing code:<P>
</B><P>
It is possible that some user code would break because it does a return<P>
from within a code body to an outer block that has the same as the<P>
newly-required block.  Such problems will be rare, and the code in<P>
question would not run on all current Common Lisp systems because of the<P>
diverse interpretations currently in effect.  It would be possible to<P>
detect all such instances automatically, though it seems unlikely that<P>
anyone will need to use this technique.<P>
<P>
<B>Discussion:<P>
</B><P>
The goal is first to clean up an ambiguous situation and, second, to do<P>
this in a way that provides consistent behavior between local and global<P>
definitions.  The proposed change would allow a simple rule of thumb:<P>
any named entity that takes a code body establishes an implicit block<P>
with the obvious name.<P>
<P>
Two alternatives to the proposal were considered and rejected:<P>
<P>
The first would be to keep the implicit block in <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defun.html#defun"><B>DEFUN</B></A>, and to clearly<P>
state that the other forms do not create implicit blocks.  This violates<P>
the goal of consistency between lexical and global definitions, and it<P>
seems to conflict with users' expectations.<P>
<P>
The second alternative was to eliminate the implicit block from <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defun.html#defun"><B>DEFUN</B></A><P>
rather than adding such blocks to other forms.  There was some feeling<P>
that specifying the implicit block in <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defun.html#defun"><B>DEFUN</B></A> was a poor design decision<P>
in the first place, since it hides a reference to the name of a function<P>
within the code of the function itself.  If a user decides to rename<P>
some function, he must be careful to rename any <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/speope_return-from.html#return-from"><B>return-from</B></A> forms within<P>
the body of the function as well.<P>
<P>
However, eliminating the implicit block in <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defun.html#defun"><B>DEFUN</B></A> would be a significant<P>
incompatible change.  Some users find this implicit block to be a great<P>
convenience for popping out of convoluted code, and some existing code<P>
makes heavy use of this feature.  While such code could be repaired<P>
automatically by searching for situations in which the user returns from<P>
a function by name and by adding an appropriate explicit block to any<P>
function containing such a forms, it would still <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_providecm_require.html#require"><B>require</B></A> more more work<P>
on existing user code than this proposal made above.<P>
<P>
There was considerable discussion in the cleanup committee about whether<P>
these implicit blocks would interfere with tail-recursion optimization,<P>
which we hope will become more common in future Common Lisp<P>
implementations.  The outcome of these discussions was general agreement<P>
that a compiler could easily eliminate the implicit block in any case<P>
where it is not actually used, and that the impact on tail-recursion<P>
optimization in compiled code is therefore minimal.<P>
