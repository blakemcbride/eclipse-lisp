<B>Status:</B>		Proposal SPECIFY passed March 1989.<P>
<P>
<B>Problem description:<P>
</B><P>
CLtL does not specify what objects can be in compiled constants and it<P>
does not say what relationship there is to be between the constant<P>
passed to the compiler and the one that is established by compiling<P>
and then loading its file.  Relevant remarks in CLtL concerning file<P>
compilation and the definition of <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/speope_quote.html#quote"><B>QUOTE</B></A> suggest that the compiler<P>
handles constants in ways that are not actually possible.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Introduction to the proposal:<P>
</B><P>
The proposal <A HREF="iss081.html">CONSTANT-COMPILABLE-TYPES:SPECIFY</A> attempts to spell out<P>
what types can appear in compiled constants, and what it means when<P>
they appear.<P>
<P>
The key is a definition of an equivalence relationship between Lisp<P>
objects, &quot;similarity as constants&quot;.  Code passed through the file<P>
compiler and then loaded must behave as though quoted constants in it<P>
are &quot;similar&quot; to quoted constants in the corresponding source code.<P>
<P>
Issue <A HREF="iss080.html">CONSTANT-COLLAPSING</A> addresses the issue of whether, for two<P>
objects that are not <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_eql.html#eql"><B>EQL</B></A> in the source code (but which are similar as<P>
constants), the corresponding objects in the compiled code may be<P>
<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_eql.html#eql"><B>EQL</B></A>.<P>
<P>
Issue <A HREF="iss079.html">CONSTANT-CIRCULAR-COMPILATION</A> addresses the issue of whether,<P>
for two objects that are <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_eql.html#eql"><B>EQL</B></A> in the source code, the corresponding<P>
objects in the compiled code must also be <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_eql.html#eql"><B>EQL</B></A>.<P>
<P>
Comments within the text of the proposal are enclosed in double angle<P>
brackets, &lt;&lt;like this&gt;&gt;.<P>
<P>
<P>
Proposal:  <A HREF="iss081.html">CONSTANT-COMPILABLE-TYPES:SPECIFY</A><P>
<P>
An object may be used as a quoted constant processed by <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_compile-file.html#compile-file"><B>COMPILE-FILE</B></A><P>
if the compiler can guarantee that the resulting constant established<P>
by loading the compiled file is &quot;similar as a constant&quot; to the<P>
original.<P>
<P>
Some types of objects, such as streams, are not supported in constants<P>
processed by the file compiler.  Such objects may not portably appear<P>
as constants in code processed with <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_compile-file.html#compile-file"><B>COMPILE-FILE</B></A>.  Conforming<P>
implementations are required to handle such objects either by having<P>
the compiler and/or loader reconstruct an equivalent copy of the<P>
object in some implementation-specific manner; or by having the<P>
compiler signal an error.<P>
<P>
Of the types supported in constants, some are treated as aggregate<P>
objects.  For these types, being similar as constants is defined<P>
recursively.  We say that an object of these types has certain &quot;basic<P>
attributes&quot;, and to be similar as a constant to another object, the<P>
values of the corresponding attributes of the two objects must also be<P>
similar as constants.<P>
<P>
This kind of definition has problems with any circular or &quot;infinitely<P>
recursive&quot; object such as a list that is an element of itself.  We use<P>
the idea of depth-limited comparison, and say that two objects are<P>
similar as constants if they are similar at all finite levels.  This<P>
idea is implicit in the definitions below, and applies in all the<P>
places where attributes of two objects are required to be similar as<P>
constants.<P>
<P>
The following terms are used throughout this proposal:<P>
<P>
  The term &quot;constant&quot; refers to a quoted or self-evaluating constant,<P>
  not a named (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defconstant.html#defconstant"><B>defconstant</B></A>) constant.<P>
<P>
  The term &quot;source code&quot; is used to refer to the objects constructed<P>
  when <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_compile-file.html#compile-file"><B>COMPILE-FILE</B></A> calls <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_readcm_re_g-whitespace.html#read"><B>READ</B></A>, and additional objects constructed by<P>
  macroexpansion during <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_compile-file.html#compile-file"><B>COMPILE-FILE</B></A>.<P>
<P>
  The term &quot;compiled code&quot; is used to refer to objects constructed by <P>
  <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_load.html#load"><B>LOAD</B></A>.<P>
<P>
Two objects are defined to be &quot;similar as a constant&quot; if and only if<P>
they are both of one of the types listed below and satisfy the<P>
additional requirements listed for that type.<P>
<P>
Number<P>
<P>
  Two numbers are similar as constants if they are of the same type<P>
  and represent the same mathematical value.<P>
  <P>
Character<P>
<P>
  Two characters are similar as constants if they both represent<P>
  the same character.<P>
<P>
  &lt;&lt;Note that this definition has to depend on the results of the<P>
  Character Set proposals.  The intent is that this be compatible with<P>
  how <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_eql.html#eql"><B>EQL</B></A> is defined on characters.&gt;&gt;<P>
<P>
Symbol<P>
<P>
  Issue <A HREF="iss063.html">COMPILE-FILE-SYMBOL-HANDLING</A> defines how the file compiler<P>
  and loader handle interned symbols.<P>
<P>
  An uninterned symbol in the source code is similar as a constant<P>
  to an uninterned symbol in the compiled code if their print names<P>
  are similar as constants.<P>
<P>
Package<P>
<P>
  A package in the source code is similar as a constant to a package in<P>
  the compiled code if their names are similar as constants.  Note that<P>
  the loader finds the corresponding package object as if by calling<P>
  <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_find-package.html#find-package"><B>FIND-PACKAGE</B></A> with the package name as an argument.  An error is<P>
  signalled if no package of that name exists at load time.<P>
<P>
Random-state<P>
<P>
  Let us say that two random-states are functionally equivalent if <P>
  applying <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_random.html#random"><B>RANDOM</B></A> to them repeatedly always produces the same <P>
  pseudo-random numbers in the same order.  <P>
  <P>
  Two random-states are similar as constants if and only if copies of<P>
  them made via <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_make-random-state.html#make-random-state"><B>MAKE-RANDOM-STATE</B></A> are functionally equivalent.<P>
<P>
  Note that a constant <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/syscla_random-state.html#random-state"><B>random-state</B></A> object cannot be used as the &quot;state&quot;<P>
  argument to the function <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_random.html#random"><B>RANDOM</B></A> (because <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_random.html#random"><B>RANDOM</B></A> side-effects this<P>
  data <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/stagenfun_doc_umentationcp.html#structure"><B>structure</B></A>).<P>
<P>
Cons<P>
<P>
  Two conses are similar as constants if the values of their respective<P>
  <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/acc_carcm_cdr_darcm_cddddr.html#car"><B>CAR</B></A> and <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/acc_carcm_cdr_darcm_cddddr.html#cdr"><B>CDR</B></A> attributes are similar as constants.<P>
<P>
Array<P>
<P>
  Two arrays are similar as constants if the corresponding values each<P>
  of the following attributes are similar as constants:<P>
<P>
  For 1-dimensional arrays:<P>
  <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_length.html#length"><B>LENGTH</B></A>, <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_array-element-type.html#array-element-type"><B>ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE</B></A>, and <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/acc_elt.html#elt"><B>ELT</B></A> for all valid indices.<P>
<P>
  For arrays of other dimensions:<P>
  <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_array-dimensions.html#array-dimensions"><B>ARRAY-DIMENSIONS</B></A>, <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_array-element-type.html#array-element-type"><B>ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE</B></A>, <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/acc_aref.html#aref"><B>AREF</B></A> for all valid indices.<P>
<P>
  In addition, if the array in the source code is a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/typ_simple-array.html#simple-array"><B>SIMPLE-ARRAY</B></A>, then<P>
  the corresponding array in the compiled code must also be a<P>
  <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/typ_simple-array.html#simple-array"><B>SIMPLE-ARRAY</B></A>.  If the array in the source code is displaced, has a<P>
  fill pointer, or is adjustable, the corresponding array in the<P>
  compiled code is permitted to lack any or all of these qualities.<P>
<P>
Hash Table   <P>
<P>
  Two hash tables are similar as constants if they meet the following<P>
  three requirements:<P>
<P>
  (1) They both have the same test (e.g., they are both <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_eql.html#eql"><B>EQL</B></A> hash tables).<P>
<P>
  (2) There is a unique one-to-one correspondence between the keys of<P>
      the two tables, such that the corresponding keys are similar as<P>
      constants.<P>
<P>
  (3) For all keys, the values associated with two corresponding keys<P>
      are similar as constants.<P>
<P>
  If there is more than one possible one-to-one correspondence between<P>
  the keys of the two tables, the results are unspecified.  A conforming<P>
  program cannot use such a table as a constant.<P>
<P>
Pathname<P>
<P>
  Two pathnames are similar as constants if all corresponding <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_pathname.html#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A><P>
  components are similar as constants.<P>
<P>
Stream, Readtable, Method<P>
<P>
  Objects of these types are not supported in compiled constants.<P>
<P>
Function<P>
<P>
  Issue <A HREF="iss082.html">CONSTANT-FUNCTION-COMPILATION</A> specifies how the compiler and<P>
  loader handle constant functions.<P>
<P>
<P>
Structure, Standard-object<P>
<P>
  &lt;&lt;There is a cl-cleanup issue, <A HREF="iss215.html">LOAD-OBJECTS</A>, pending which proposes<P>
  a mechanism for dealing with objects.&gt;&gt;<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Rationale:<P>
</B><P>
For the benefit of users, this proposal tries to define a fairly large<P>
set of types that all Common Lisp implementations are to handle.  It<P>
also attempts to leave room for implementations to differ.  Some<P>
implementations have made opposing choices because the language<P>
doesn't specify one over the other.  Some implementations already<P>
handle constants that this proposal defines as not valid in Common<P>
Lisp programs, and that is useful to users of those systems.<P>
Different implementors have different amounts of resources to apply to<P>
their system, and implementations differ in their whole approach in<P>
some cases.<P>
<P>
This proposal appears to reflect user demand and appears not to exceed<P>
the capabilities of most implementations of the language.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Current practice:<P>
</B><P>
&gt;From Gail Zacharias (Nov 14): &quot;Coral pretty much implements this<P>
proposal (I think we currently coalesce hash table keys, but that's<P>
just a bug that will be fixed).  We also fasdump packages (using the<P>
package name) and compiled functions (but not foreign functions).  For<P>
symbols, we dump the name, and if (roughly speaking) the symbol would<P>
get printed with a package prefix, we also dump the package name and<P>
load the symbol into that package (otherwise it gets loaded into the<P>
current load-time package).&quot;<P>
<P>
&gt;From David Gray (Nov 9): &quot;The Explorer can compile constant functions,<P>
read tables, and hash tables; an error is signalled for a stream.  A<P>
package object used to break the compiler but in release 5 it has been<P>
fixed to generate instructions to call <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_find-package.html#find-package"><B>FIND-PACKAGE</B></A> on the package<P>
name at load time.&quot;  (Nov 15): [The Explorer does not guarantee<P>
retention of displaced-to and displaced-index-offset attributes.]<P>
&quot;The Explorer also does not currently support dumping closures (either<P>
compiled or evaluated), although non-closure compiled functions can be<P>
dumped.&quot;<P>
<P>
&gt;From David Moon (Jan 24): &quot;Symbolics Genera current practice: aside<P>
from some current bugs we have with circular structures of certain<P>
types and with preserving the identity of CONSes under <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_eq.html#eq"><B>EQ</B></A>, this is<P>
more or less consistent with our current practice, if you made the<P>
changes implied by my earlier comments.  We preserve the :displaced-to<P>
and :fill-pointer array attributes.  I doubt that we do what the<P>
proposal says for hash-tables, readtables, and random-states.  We<P>
support dumping compiled and interpreted functions, but not closures,<P>
which in effect means we don't support dumping functions.&quot;<P>
<P>
&gt;From Sandra Loosemore (Mar 3): &quot;UCL currently can handle only<P>
constants that are of type number, character, symbol, cons,<P>
<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/typ_simple-vector.html#simple-vector"><B>simple-vector</B></A>, or string (which it turns into <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/typ_simple-string.html#simple-string"><B>simple-string</B></A>).  It<P>
signals an error if an attempt is made to compile any other kind of<P>
object as a constant.&quot;<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Adoption cost:<P>
</B><P>
Not known.  Probably moderate or low -- for most implementations.  The<P>
cost would be to implementors rather than users since this part of the<P>
language is currently underspecified.  The author believes the cost<P>
will be reasonable for KCL, an implementation where there is some<P>
concern about this issue.<P>
<P>
This proposal is close to compatible with the Franz, Lucid, Coral,<P>
Texas Instruments, and Symbolics implementations.  It is probably<P>
compatible or nearly compatible with other &quot;Lisp Machine&quot;<P>
implementations.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Benefits:<P>
</B><P>
Users would be able to use aggregate objects in constants with<P>
confidence about the behavior of their code.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Conversion cost:<P>
</B><P>
Where this proposal *requires* different behavior than an existing<P>
implementation, there is a conversion cost for users of that<P>
implementation.  It appears that this cost will be small, less than<P>
the cost of leaving things unspecified.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Esthetics:<P>
</B><P>
Since there is no adequate definition at present, a fuller definition<P>
would be more esthetic.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Discussion:<P>
</B><P>
This proposal does leave some user-visible attributes of objects<P>
unspecified across the compile-and-load process, except that they must<P>
be consistent with the attributes that must be retained.  This<P>
situation is a compromise between the desire for full specification on<P>
the one hand, and on the other hand the desire to leave freedom for<P>
different implementations to remain different and to support some<P>
optimizations such as compacting hash tables and &quot;simplifying&quot; arrays.<P>
<P>
Proposals will be entertained for tighter specification of datatypes<P>
such as arrays.<P>
<P>
The definition of similarity for random-states supports the<P>
possibility of random states that are immutable because of being in<P>
compiled constants.<P>
<P>
Readtables need not be supported by an implementation.  If a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/syscla_readtable.html#readtable"><B>readtable</B></A><P>
contains only symbols to represent functions, here is Cris Perdue's<P>
suggested spec for similarity of readtables:<P>
<P>
  Character syntax type for each character in the table;<P>
  function for each readmacro character, mappings for<P>
  dispatch macros; whether terminating or nonterminating<P>
  for each readmacro.<P>
<P>
Interest has been expressed by a number of people including users, in<P>
support for user-definable &quot;dumping&quot; of CLOS objects and <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/stagenfun_doc_umentationcp.html#structure"><B>structure</B></A><P>
instances.  The cleanup issue <A HREF="iss215.html">LOAD-OBJECTS</A> deals with this.<P>
<P>
This subsumes the issue CONSTANT-ARRAY-ATTRIBUTES.<P>
<P>
Earlier versions of this proposal specified an additional constraint<P>
on uninterned symbols, requiring EQLness to be preserved across the<P>
entire file.  However, this special case was removed because it was<P>
thought that including it in this issue made its presentation<P>
unnecessarily complicated, since preservation of EQLness is really a<P>
separate issue (<A HREF="iss079.html">CONSTANT-CIRCULAR-COMPILATION</A>).  A consequence of the<P>
decision to remove the special casing for uninterned symbols is that,<P>
unless we accept one of the two <A HREF="iss079.html">CONSTANT-CIRCULAR-COMPILATION</A><P>
proposals that requires EQLness of constants to be preserved, the<P>
behavior for uninterned symbols will be rather strange.  PCL will<P>
reportedly break if uninterned symbols that are <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_eql.html#eql"><B>EQL</B></A> in the source code<P>
do not remain <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_eql.html#eql"><B>EQL</B></A> in the compiled code.<P>
