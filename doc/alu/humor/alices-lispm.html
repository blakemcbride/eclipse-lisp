	This song is called "MIT's AI Lab". It's about MIT and the AI
Lab, but "MIT's AI Lab" is not the name of the lab, that's just the
name of the song. That's why I call the song "MIT's AI Lab."<P>

	Now it all started two full dumps ago, on Thanksgiving, when
my friend and I went up to visit the hackers at AI lab on the ninth
floor. But the hackers don't always live on the ninth floor, they just
go there to use these complex order code stack machines they call Lisp
Machines.<P>

	And using a special purpose processor like that, they got a lot
of room upstairs where DDT used to be, and havin' all that ROOM they
decided that they didn't have to collect any garbage for a long time.<P>

	We JFCLed up here and found all the garbage in there and we
decided that it'd be a friendly gesture for us to take all the garbage
down to the system dump.<P>

	So we took the half-a-meg of garbage, put it in the back of a
red ECL Multibus, took subrs and hacks and implementations of
defstruction, and headed on toward the system dump.<P>

	Well, we got there and there was a big pop up window and a
write protect across the dump sayin', "This Garbage Collecter Under
Development on Thanksgiving," and we'd never heard of a garbage
collector NOP'd out on Thanksgiving before, and with tears in our eyes,
we CDR'd off into the sunset lookin' for another place to put the
garbage.<P>

	We didn't find one 'til we came to a side area, and off the side
of the side area was three hundred megabyte disk, and in the middle of
the disk was another heap of garbage. And we decided that one big heap
was better than two little heaps, and rather than page that one in, we
decided to write ours out. That's what we did.<P>

	Branched back to the Lisp Listener, had a Chinese Thanksgiving
dinner that couldn't be beat, went to SI:PROCESS-WAIT SLEEP, and didn't
get up until the next quantum, when we got a funcall from Mr.
Greenblatt.  He said, "Kid, we found your name on a cons at
the bottom of a half-a-meg of garbage and I just wanted to know if you
had any information about it".<P>

	And I said, "Yes sir, Mr. Greenblatt, I cannot tell a lie. I
put that structure under that garbage." After speakin' to Greenblatt
for about forty-five million clock ticks on the telnet stream, we
finally arrived at the truth of the matter and he said that we had to
go down and link up the garbage, and also had to go down and speak to
him at the Lisp Machine Factory. So we got in the red ECL Multibus
with the subrs and hacks and implementations of defstruction and
headed on toward the Lisp Machine Factory.<P>

	Now, friends, there was only one of two things that Greenblatt
could've done at the Lisp Machine Factory, and the first was that he
could've given us another 64K board for bein' so brave and honest on
BUG-LISPM (which wasn't very likely, and we didn't expect it), and the
other thing was that he could've flamed at us and told us never to be
seen BLTing garbage around in the vicinity again, which is what we
expected.<P>

	But when we got to the Lisp Machine Factory, there was a
third COND-clause that we hadn't even counted upon, and we was both
immediately Process-Arrested, Deexposed, and I said, "Greenblatt, I
can't GC up the garbage with these here ARREST-REASONS on". He said:
"Output-Hold, kid, and get in the back of the Control CAR." ...And that's
what we did...sat in the back of the Control CAR, and drove to the
sharpsign quote open scene-of-the-crime close.<P>

	I wanna tell you 'bout the town of Cambridge, Massachusetts,
where this is happenin'. They got seven hunnert stop signs, no turn on
red, and two campus police CARs, but when we got to the
sharpsign-quote-open scene-of-the-crime close, there was five Lisp
Machine hackers and three scope carts, bein' the biggest hack of the
last ten years and everybody wanted to get in the HUMAN-NETS story
about it.<P>

	And they was usin' up all kinds of digital equipment that they
had hangin' around the Lisp Machine Factory. They was takin'
backtraces, stack traces, plastic wire wraps, blueprints, and microcode
loads...And they made seventeen 1K-by-32 pixel multi-flavored windows
with turds and arrows and a scroll bar on the side of each one with
documentation panes explainin' what each one was, to be used as
evidence against us.<P>

...Took pictures of the labels, blinkers, the cursors, the pop up
notification windows, the upper right corner, the lower left corner
...and that's not to mention the XGP'd screen images!<P>

	After the ordeal, we went back to the Factory. Greenblatt said he
was gonna locate us in a cell. He said: "Kid, I'm gonna INTERN you in a
cell. I want your manual and your mouse."<P>

	I said, "Greenblatt, I can understand your wantin' my manual, so
I don't have any documentation about the cell, but what do you want my
mouse for?" and he said, "Kid, we don't want any window system problems". 
I said, "Greenblatt, did you think I was gonna deexpose myself for
litterin'?"<P>

	Greenblatt said he was makin' sure, and, friends, Greenblatt
was, 'cause he took out the left Meta-key so I couldn't double bucky the
rubout and cold-boot, and he took out the Inspector so I couldn't
click-left on Modify, set the PROCESS-WARM-BOOT-ACTION on the window,
*THROW around the UNWIND-PROTECT and have an escape. Greenblatt was
makin' sure.<P>

	It was about four or five hours later that Moon--(remember Moon?
This here's not a song about Moon)-- Moon came by and, with a few nasty
sends to Greenblatt on the side, bailed us out of core, and we went up
to the Loft, had another Chinese dinner that couldn't be beat, and
didn't get up until the next evening, when we all had to go to court.<P>

	We walked in, sat down, Greenblatt came in with the seventeen
1K-by-32 pixel multi-flavored windows with turds and arrows and
documentation panes, sat down.<P>

	McMahon came in, said, "All rise!" We all stood up, and
Greenblatt stood up with the seventeen 1K-by-32 pixel multi-flavored
windows with turds and arrows and documentation panes, and the judge
walked in, with an LA36, and he sat down. We sat down.<P>

	Greenblatt looked at the LA36... then at the seventeen multi
flavored windows with the turds and arrows and documentation panes...
and looked at the LA36... and then at the seventeen 1K-by-32 pixel
multi-flavored windows with turds and arrows and documentation panes,
and began to cry.<P>

	Because Greenblatt came to the realization that it was a typical
case of LCS state-of-the-art technology, and there wasn't nothin' he
could do about it, and the judge wasn't gonna look at the seventeen
1K-by-32 pixel multi-flavored windows with turds and arrows and
documentation panes, explainin' what each one was, to be used as
evidence against us.<P>

	And we was fined fifty zorkmids and had to rebuild the world
load...in the snow.<P>


	But that's not what I'm here to tell you about.
	I'm here to talk about the Lab.<P>

<hr><P>
	They got a buildin' down in Cambridge called Technology Square,
where you walk in, you get your windows Inspected, detected, neglected
and Selected!<P>

	I went down and got my interview one day, and I walked in, sat
down (slept on the beanbag in 926 the night before, so I looked and felt
my best when I went in that morning, 'cause I wanted to look like the
All-American High School Tourist from Sunnyvale. I wanted to feel like
... I wanted to be the All-American Kid from Sunnyvale), and I walked in,
sat down, I was gunned down, brung down, locked out and all kinds of
mean, nasty, ugly things.<P>

	And I walked in, I sat down, KAREN gave me a piece of paper that
said: "Kid, see the CLU hackers on XX."<P>

	I went up there, I said, "Eliot, I wanna lose. I wanna lose!
I wanna see hacks and kludges and unbound variables and cruft in my
code! Eat dead power supplies with cables between my teeth! I mean
lose! lose! lose!"<P>

	And I started jumpin' up and down, yellin' "LOSE! LOSE! LOSE!"
and Stallman walked in and started jumpin' up and down with me, and we
was both jumpin' up and down, yellin', "LOSE! LOSE! LOSE! LOSE!!" and<P>

some professor
came over, gave me a 6-3 degree, sent me down the hall, said "You're
our distinguished lecturer." Didn't feel too good about it.<P>

	Proceeded down the infinite corridor, gettin' more inspections,
rejections (this IS MIT), detections, neglections, and all kinds of
stuff that they was doin' to me there, and I was there for
two years... three years... four years... I was there for a long
time goin' through all kinds of mean, nasty, kludgy things, and I was
havin' a tough time there, and they was inspectin', injectin', every
single part of me, and they was leavin' no part unbound!<P>

<hr><P>

	Proceeded through, and I finally came to see the very last man.
I walked in, sat down, after a whole big thing there. I walked up, and
he said, "Kid, we only got one question: Have you ever been arrested"?<P>

	And I proceeded to tell him the story of the half-a-meg of garbage
with full orchestration and five-part harmony and stuff like that, and
other phenomenon.<P>

	He stopped me right there and said, "Kid, have you ever been to
court"? And I proceeded to tell him the story of the seventeen
1K-by-32 pixel multi-flavored windows with turds and arrows and
documentation panes... <P>

	He stopped me right there and said, "Kid, I want you to go over
and sit down on that bench that says 'LISP Machine Group'... NOW, KID!"<P>

	And I walked over to the bench there, and there's... The LISP
Machine Group is where they put you if you may not be moral enough to
join Symbolics after creatin' your special form.<P>

	There was all kinds of mean, nasty, ugly-lookin' people on the
bench there ... there was Microcoders, DPL hackers, File System
hackers, and Window System HAckers!! Window System hacker sittin'
right there on the bench next to me! And the meanest, ugliest,
nastiest one... the kludgiest Window System hacker of them all... was
comin' over to me, and he was mean and ugly and nasty and horrible and
all kinds of things, and he sat down next to me. He said, "Kid, you
get a new copy of the sources?" I said, "I didn't get nothin'. I had
to rebuild the world load."<P>

	He said, "What were you arrested for, kid?" and I said,
"Littering..." And they all moved away from me on the bench there,
with the hairy eyeball and all kinds of mean, nasty things, 'til I
said, "And making gratuitous modifications to LMIO; sources..." And
they all came back, shook my hand, and we had a great time on the
bench talkin' about microcoding, DPL designing, file-system hacking,
... and all kinds of groovy things that we was talkin' about on the
bench, and everything was fine.<P>

	We was drinking Coke smoking all kinds of things, until the RA
came over, had some paper in his hand, held it up and said:<P>

"KIDS-THIS-EXAM-S-GOT-FOURTY
SEVEN-WORDS-THIRTY-SEVEN-MULTIPLE-CHOICE-QUESTIONS
FIFTY-EIGHT-WORDS-WE-WANT-TO-KNOW-THE-DETAILS
OF-THE-HACK-THE-TIME-OF-THE-HACK-AND-ANY
OTHER-KIND-OF-THING-YOU-GOT-TO-SAY
PERTAINING-TO-AND-ABOUT-THE-HACK-ANY-OTHER
KIND-OF-THING-YOU-GOT-TO-SAY-WE-WANT-TO-KNOW-THE-ARRESTED-PROCESS'-NAME-AND-ANY
OTHER-KIND-OF-THING..."<P>

And he talked for forty-five minutes and nobody understood a word that
he said. But we had fun rolling the mice around and clickin' on the
buttons.<P>

	I filled out the special form with the four-level macro defining
macros.  Typed it in there just like it was and everything was fine.
And I put down my keyboard, and I switched buffers, and there ...  in
the other buffer...  centered in the other buffer...  away from
everything else in the buffer... in parentheses, capital letters,
backquotated, in 43VXMS, read the following words: "Kid, have you
featurized yourself"?<P>

	I went over to the RA. Said, "Mister, you got a lot of damned
gall to ask me if I've featurized myself!  I mean, I mean, I mean
that you send, I'm sittin' here on the bench, I mean I'm sittin' here on
the Lisp Machine Group bench, 'cause you want to know if I'm losing
enough to join the Lab, burn PROMs, power supplies, and documentation,
after bein' on SF-LOVERS?"<P>

<hr><P>
	He looked at me and said, "Kid, we don't like your kind!  We're
gonna send your user-id off to the DCA in Washington"!  And, friends,
somewhere in Washington, enshrined on some little floppy disk, is a
study in ones and zeros of my brain-damaged programming style...<P>
<hr><P>

	And the only reason I'm singin' you the song now is 'cause you
may know somebody in a similar situation. Or you may be in a similar
situation, and if you're in a situation like that, there's only one
thing you can do:<P>

[ CHORUS ]<P>

	You  know, if one person, just one person, does it, they may
think he's really dangerous and they won't take him.<P>

	And if two people do it, in harmony, they may think they're
both LISP hackers and they won't take either of them.<P>

	And if three people do it!  Can you imagine three people
walkin' in, singin' a bar of "MIT's AI Lab" and walkin' out? They may
think it's an re-implementation of the window system!<P>

	And can you imagine fifty people a day? I said FIFTY people a
day, walkin' in, singin' a bar of "MIT's AI Lab" and walkin' out?
Friends, they may think it's a MOVEMENT, and that's what it is: THE
MIT AI LAB ANTI-LOSSAGE MOVEMENT! And all you gotta do to join is to
sing it the next time it comes around on the circular buffer.<P>

	With feelin'.<P>

You can hack anything you want<br>
on MIT Lisp Machines<br>
You can hack anything you want<br>
on MIT Lisp Machines<br>
Walk right in and begin to hack<br>
Just push your stuff right onto the stack<br>
You can hack anything you want<br>
on MIT Lisp Machines<P>

(but dont forget to fix the bug...on MIT Lisp Machines!)<P>
