<h3>Abstract</h3>
</p>

<p>

As World-Wide Web applications become increasingly interactive,
interpreting user input incurs a significant amount of overhead and
complexity on the host server.  W3P is an abstract, extensible Common
LISP system for manipulating input and output as CLOS objects, allowing
simpler applications with less code duplication.  To facilitate
compatibility with existing LISP applications, W3P implements a subset
of the LISP interface to the Common LISP Interface Manager.  W3P,
however, was conceived to specifically address the requirements of a
stateless model of interaction such as the World-Wide Web.  Once a CLOS
class has been profiled with its essential parameters and visual
attributes, input type-checking and output rendering can be performed
automatically.  Developers can utilize standard interface
characteristics or choose to define their own visual representations of
objects and input parsing routines.  W3P has been applied to CL-HTTP, a
portable, full-featured World-Wide Web server implemented in Common
LISP.  Major advantages are evident in form-processing, which mostly
involves parsing, validity checking, and building objects from textual
input.  W3P represents an effort to create a streamlined, highly
portable, non-proprietary presentation system tailored to the stateless
model of the World-Wide Web.

</p>

<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
</p>

<p>

The rapid proliferation of the World-Wide Web has led to fundamental
changes in its model of user interaction.  Servers have become more than
simple information repositories, providing dynamic content tailored to
the needs of individual users.  Utilizing the World-Wide Web as a medium
for interactive applications places considerable strain on conventional
development techniques.  W3P is a modular, extensible Common LISP system
for manipulating input and output as CLOS objects, allowing abstract
management of dynamic content and user interaction.  W3P implements a
subset of the LISP interface to the Common LISP Interface Manager.  This
design consideration facilitates basic compatibility with existing
Common LISP systems.  While the core functionality of the W3P system is
designed for compatibility with CLIM, it is structured for the
requirements of a rather different model of user interaction.  The
stateless nature of the World-Wide Web requires that a presentation
system perform gracefully without a persistent connection to the user,
as well as addressing the performance requirements of a production
server.  CL-HTTP [3], a server implemented in Common LISP, has been used
to apply a number of existing dynamic systems to the World-Wide Web.  As
in any interactive application, a great deal of overhead and complexity
is incurred interpreting user input and rendering output.  W3P abstracts
away much of this functionality, resulting in simpler implementations
with less code duplication.  Dealing with user interaction at a higher
level allows developers to more efficiently construct powerful, dynamic
World-Wide Web applications.

</p>

<p>
<h3>System Structure</h3>
</p>

<p>

The basic W3P system facilitates the definition of a presentation type
lattice similar to that of the Common LISP Object System, allowing
inheritance of specializing parameters and options.  Presentation
generic functions are defined to act on these presentation types,
utilizing CLOS method combination.  The system for registering and
managing presentation types and generic functions was implemented in
about 400 lines of portable Common LISP code.  Standard presentation
type definitions similar to those in CLIM are supplied, as well as
standard presentation methods.  Standard methods include those for
parsing input, rendering output, handling input errors, and prompting a
user for a particular type of data.  While this set of methods will be
sufficient for most developers, additional functionality can be defined
using the interface to the basic system.

</p>

<p>

The W3P system also allows the definition of presentation views that use
CLOS class inheritance.  Views facilitate the specialization of
presentation methods over different content types or styles.  Consider,
for instance, a presentation type describing an item of technical
documentation.  The developer may wish to specify methods for plain
textual output such as electronic mail, for a mark-up language like
HTML, or even for a graphical representation.  In addition, one may with
to define an abbreviated view for technical experts and a detailed view
for novice users.

</p>

<p>

W3P condition handling must also be highly modular and configurable.
Varying applications will have very different needs when it comes to
responding to input errors.  Applications such as detailed online
surveys will need to gracefully prompt the user for precisely the set of
data that was found invalid.  Some applications may choose to proceed
without certain data rather than initiating another prompt.  If
error-detection has already taken place on the client end, a server may
abort a process as soon as an invalid input item is detected.

</p>

<p>
<h3>W3P and CLIM</h3>
</p>

<p>

W3P and CLIM operate on the same basic principle: profiling CLOS objects
through presentation types, allowing developers to abstractly manage
input parsing and output rendering.  Some CL-HTTP applications already
use CLIM for managing dynamic output.  While CLIM can be configured to
function in a stateless model like the World-Wide Web, it was often
found to be a much more powerful tool than was necessary.  CL-HTTP
requires a lightweight, highly portable, non-proprietary presentation
system designed specifically for the tasks at hand.  The basic concepts
that W3P follow can be traced back to, among others, Eugene Ciccarelli's
PTBase system [1], which used presentation types in conjunction with
presenter and recognizer methods.  An early implementation of W3P used a
different LISP interface, but a design decision was made to facilitate
some basic CLIM compatibility.  The design objective was not to recreate
a full-featured user interface manager, but to allow developers to
utilize existing libraries of presentation types and parsing routines.
Many CLIM capabilities such as output histories and real-time completion
are largely inappropriate when applied to the World-Wide Web in its
current state.  Valuable features for conventional LISP applications can
become unnecessary overhead in a Web interface.  W3P does not suffice as
a replacement for CLIM, but will help fill the need for a streamlined
presentation system tailored to the World-Wide Web.  The hope is that
W3P will help bring dynamic object presentation systems to a wider base
of developers.

</p>

<p>
<h3>Form Processing</h3>
</p>

<p>

W3P is especially valuable as a tool for form-processing.  Implementing
World-Wide Web interfaces which utilize HTML forms capabilities consists
mostly of parsing textual input, type and validity checking, and
building CLOS objects from the parsed input.  This type of low-level,
repetitious code increases complexity, is difficult to reconfigure, and
is prone to programmer error.  Abstracting away these tasks allows rapid
prototyping and efficient reconfiguration of applications.  Generically
parsing and rendering objects allows not only dynamic content, but a
flexible interface tailored to the needs of a particular user.  An
application has the ability to deliver a dynamic form, requesting a
precise set of required input data.  Presentation types and configurable
condition handling allow meaningful error reporting when input is
invalid.

</p>

<p>

An initial application of W3P has been a remote server configuration
system for CL-HTTP.  Through a password protected World-Wide Web
document, webmasters can dynamically configure parameters such as the
number of simultaneous connections allowed or how logging should be
performed.  When combined with Web-based log analysis tools, this allows
maintainers to remotely observe server performance and act upon the
information immediately.  W3P is an important part of this process for
several reasons.  Type and parameter checking are especially important
here, protecting against accidental corruption of vital server objects.
Using presentation types allows a highly configurable interface.  For
instance, some maintainers may only be granted access to certain
configuration parameters.  Some webmasters may require more detailed
parameter explanations, while others may prefer a very basic interface.

Figure 1: A portion of the remote server configuration interface to CL-HTTP.

</p>

<p>

This interface is generated using W3P in conjunction with HTML synthesis
tools and a system for managing CL-HTTP server preferences.  The entire
interface is implemented in about 70 lines of Common LISP, including
methods for computing the form and responding to input.  The following
selection of code is the loop that generates the html form in Figure 1,
where *remote-configuration-form-prototype* is a list of keywords
specifying CL-HTTP server preferences.

</p>

<p>

<code>
<pre>

(html:with-fillout-form (:post url :stream stream)
  (loop for item in *remote-configuration-form-prototype*
    for preference = (find-preference item nil)
    when preference
    do (html:with-paragraph (:stream stream)
         (w3p:accept (preference-presentation-type preference)
           :stream stream 
           :view w3p:+html-view+ 
           :present-p t
           :default (funcall (preference-value-getter preference))
           :prompt (preference-prompt preference) 
           :prompt-mode :raw
           :display-default nil
           :query-identifier (symbol-name (preference-keyword preference))
           :insert-default t)
         (html:break-line :stream stream)
         (write-string (preference-description preference) stream))
         finally (html:with-paragraph (:stream stream)
                   (html:accept-input 'html:submit-button "SUBMIT"
                                      :display-string "Configure" 
                                      :stream stream))))

</pre>
</code>

</p>

<p>

Using W3P along with CL-HTTP HTML synthesis tools allowed the rapid
construction of this functional interface to a Common LISP system.
Future candidates for W3P include COMLINK, a system that already
implements dynamic forms using CLIM substrate.

</p>

<p>
<h3>Client-Side Extensions</h3>
</p>

<p>

Future plans for W3P include the utilization of mobile code to create
more powerful user interfaces on the World-Wide Web.  Client-side
extensions will allow input completion and preliminary type-checking, as
well as less cumbersome graphical elements.  While mobile code can help
provide some real-time feedback to the user, the interface must still
perform gracefully without a persistent connection to the server.  This
means that input completion is somewhat limited, since it is only
feasible to send relatively small sets of data along with an HTML form.
Mobile type and parameter checking will significantly reduce server
computation by moving most input error reporting to the client.  A final
input validation must still be performed on the server, but without the
potential overhead of generating a meaningful error report.  While
generating this kind of disconnected interface may seem awkward at
first, it will be a valuable tool as the World-Wide Web continues to
proliferate.  Pushing this functionality down toward the client allows
servers to interact with a larger base of users.  A W3P presentation
embedded with mobile code can be cached and redistributed like any other
resource.

</p>

<p>

Consider the case of a widely-distributed user survey conducted over the
Web.  A form would generally include a number of questions, each with a
corresponding set of acceptable input.  In the conventional model, a
user must commit to a large set of data at once, waiting for the server
to validate input.  The server potentially becomes a bottleneck,
generating customized error reports for thousands of users.  When a W3P
presentation includes most of this functionality as part of the form,
the server can deal more efficiently with incoming requests.  Since
input validation has already occured, the server check is simply a
security consideration.  Requests containing invalid input may be
discarded and a generic error returned.  As the World-Wide Web evolves
into a more decentralized, cache-oriented environment, this type of
highly portable interface becomes increasingly important.

</p>

<p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
</p>

<p>

W3P is an effort to create a streamlined, highly portable presentation
system for managing complexity in stateless models of user interaction.
While the system was designed with the World-Wide Web in mind, it can be
readily applied to other interfaces such as automated electronic mail.
As the World-Wide Web becomes increasingly interactive, developers need
a greater selection of tools for dealing with user interaction at a
higher level.  W3P is a simple, yet highly extensible Common LISP system
for presenting and accepting CLOS objects to and from the user.  Partial
CLIM compatibility facilitates use of existing presentation types and
parsing routines, as well as introducing a larger base of developers to
some of CLIM's basic capabilities.  W3P has been tested with CL-HTTP as
a tool for creating user interfaces on the World-Wide Web.  Major
advantages are evident in form processing, where parsing and
type-checking incur a significant amount of overhead and complexity.
W3P's modular system structure, allowing extension and performance
tuning, lends itself to use as part of a production World-Wide Web
server.  Client-side extensions will use the same presentation model to
output interfaces that are more responsive to the user.  The evolving
role of the World-Wide Web as an interactive medium has emphasized the
need for presentation type oriented interface development tools.  W3P
helps address this need with a simple, portable, configurable
presentation system.
